dataset - TripAdvisor reviews extracted by UiPath web-scraping robot (reviews (string) + rating (bubble rating))

The following rep is my NLP thesis project converted into interactive sentiment analysis app where a user can:
* explore the Trip Advisor reviews' - most frequent nouns, verbs and adjectives; topic modeling (BERTopic)
* investigate the rating distribution
* analyse sentiment (Bert) and emotion (Ekman model) of the review
